I want to build a Cast Iron Recipe and Cooking App for my website, www.mycookwarecare.com. The app will aggregate recipes from cast iron-focused cooking sites and allow user-generated content. Hereâ€™s what I need: Key Features: Recipe Aggregator: Scrape and pull recipes from other cast iron recipe websites with proper attribution. Allow users to submit recipes through a form, which can be curated and adapted for cast iron cooking. User Features: Enable users to suggest edits to recipes, specifically adapting them for cast iron cookware. Allow users to comment on recipes, rate them, and upvote their favorites. Shopping List: A tool to generate shopping lists from selected recipes, categorized by ingredient type. Option to export the shopping list or share it. Filters: Allow filtering recipes by cookware type (skillet, Dutch oven, etc.), skill level, meal type (breakfast, dinner, etc.), and dietary preferences. Educational Tools: Include cast iron care guides, tips, and tutorials (video and text). Provide links to my own products, such as Seasoning Wipes and Seasoning Oil Blend, for easy purchase. Technical Requirements: Build the app as a web application that integrates seamlessly with my existing website (Shopify hosted at www.mycookwarecare.com). Use a responsive design so it works on both desktop and mobile. Store recipe and user data securely in a database. Include an admin panel where I can manage recipes, user submissions, and comments. Monetization: Add affiliate link support for products used in recipes. Integrate e-commerce capabilities for selling my own products. Stack Preferences: Frontend: React.js (or a simple HTML/CSS/JS interface if React is too complex). Backend: Node.js with Express or Flask (Python) for handling recipe scraping, user submissions, and APIs. Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for recipe and user data. Output: Provide a functional app that can be deployed and embedded on my website. Share clear instructions for hosting and integrating with my existing platform. Include placeholder content to demonstrate functionality.
